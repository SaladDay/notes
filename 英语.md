一天文学家要确定一颗小行星绕太阳运行的轨道，他在轨道平面内建立以太 阳为原点的直角坐标系，其单位为天文测量单位。在 5 个不同的时间对小行星作 了 5 次观察，测得轨道上 5 个点的坐标数据如下表:

|      | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     |
| ---- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| x    | 5.764 | 6.286 | 6.759 | 7.168 | 7.408 |
| y    | 0.648 | 1.202 | 1.823 | 2.526 | 3.360 |

请确定该小行星绕太阳运行的轨道，并且画出小行星的运动轨迹。(提示: 假定小行星的轨道是一个椭圆，将椭圆的另一个焦点坐标和长轴长度作为未知数， 根据这 5 个点的坐标和太阳焦点，建立非线性方程组，解出这些参数
